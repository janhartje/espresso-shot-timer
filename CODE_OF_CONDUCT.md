# Code of Conduct

We want this project to be a welcoming place for everyone.

**The Golden Rule: Be nice.**

*   **Respect each other**: Constructive feedback is great; insults are not.
*   **Be inclusive**: Everyone is welcome, regardless of background.
*   **No harassment**: Any form of harassment or bullying will result in a ban.

Let's build cool stuff together and have fun!
