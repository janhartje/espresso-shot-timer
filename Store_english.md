Get the best out of your espresso machine – with Espresso Shot Timer.

Unlike ordinary stopwatches, this app uses your smartphone's accelerometer to detect the vibration of your espresso machine. Simply place your phone on the drip tray or cup rest, and the timer starts and stops automatically as soon as the pump runs.

Features:
- Auto-Start & Stop: No hands needed. The timer responds precisely to your machine starting.
- Calibration: Individually adapts to your machine's vibrations.
- Precision Timer: Displays time in seconds and milliseconds.
- History: Automatically saves the time of your last shot.
- Modern Design: Clean, dark interface that fits perfectly next to your machine.
- Energy Efficient: Uses sensors intelligently to save battery.

Perfect for home baristas and coffee lovers who want to optimize their workflow and achieve reproducible results without buying extra hardware.
